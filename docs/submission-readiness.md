# Submission readiness

This is the mechanical release gate for the Scaffold-HBAR template. Passing
tests in the source repository is necessary but not sufficient. The generated
project and the public testnet proof must also pass.

## Repository gate

- `template.json` has a valid name, description, version, requirements, and
  Scaffold-HBAR defaults.
- The license is MIT and third-party notices remain intact.
- No environment file, key, mnemonic, keystore, or funded credential is tracked.
- Immutable installation, formatting, linting, type checking, compilation,
  tests, production build, route checks, ABI checks, and secret scans pass.
- Browser tests start their own isolated server and pass at desktop and mobile
  viewports.
- Harness recipe validation passes without requiring funded credentials.

Run the complete local gate from an immutable install:

```sh
yarn install --immutable
yarn release:validate
```

## Generated-project gate

After merging to `main`, run the Fresh scaffold gate. It must generate the
public template into an empty directory, install it, repeat the repository gate,
boot the application without an environment file, and load `/`, `/facility`,
and `/verify`.

Inspect the generated outro as a user would see it. No step may require a wallet
to enter reference mode.

## Hedera evidence gate

The committed reference record is publishable only when:

- schema validation succeeds;
- the network is Hedera testnet and the recipe is `term-credit`;
- all public dependencies and deployed contracts are confirmed;
- every transaction proof is successful and Mirror-confirmed;
- HSS proof names a real schedule, and an HSS terminal path has an execution
  timestamp plus a later terminal state read;
- a permissionless terminal path names its successful settlement transaction;
- two distinct ATS holds produce one repaid and one defaulted position;
- both ATS hold details have opening proofs and final-block deletion proofs;
- ATS roles, KYC, Clearing mode, decimals, nominal configuration, maturity,
  free balances, and held balances are read live;
- funding, acceptance, repayment, and fallback labels are bound to decoded
  receipt events from the expected contracts;
- Pyth data, immutable policy, liabilities, reserves, and solvency are complete;
- the candidate contains no private material and passes the secret scan.

Until that gate passes, the committed record must stay visibly pending.

## Release gate

1. Confirm source CI is green.
2. Publish and manually inspect the testnet evidence.
3. Confirm every public HashScan and Mirror link.
4. Merge to `main` and pass the public Fresh scaffold gate.
5. Record dated setup, validation, and lifecycle measurements.
6. Confirm the submitted commit matches the reviewed commit.
7. Tag `v1.0.0` only after every item above is green.
